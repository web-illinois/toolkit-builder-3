        <h2>Allowing Students to Reach Their Highest Potentials</h2>
        <p>Students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign enjoy a University that celebrates diversity, serves their health and wellness needs, and allows them to reach their highest potentials, both academically and personally. 450,000+ Illini graduates have been shaped by their time at our University and many say they are who they are because of it. Student Affairs is making sure this tradition continues, and, with your help, we will meet the needs of a changing student body.</p>

    Developing the Leaders of the Future
</h2>
<p>
    As the student experience changes, we can be the international leader for student affairs. We seek to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        bring more students and cultures together
    </li>
    <li>
        create more spaces for student activity
    </li>
    <li>
        better serve communities, and
    </li>
    <li>
        meet all the rapidly changing needs of today’s and tomorrow’s Illinois students.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>With Illinois, we can redefine the way Student Affairs can transform lives and develop the leaders of the future.</strong>
